	<p>Mablean Ephriam was born to Robert and Mable Ephriam in Hazlehurst, Mississippi. She is no stranger to achievement.  Through hard, consistent and dedicated work, she strives to perform and do her God-given best.  Since a child, she has always had that “spirit” of excellence and liberality about her.  The ninth of ten children, you could always find her somewhere reading, studying, and asking countless questions that could drive you crazy.  When she wasn’t doing that, she could be found fighting for the rights of strangers and family members.  Her strong thirst for knowledge, equality and unselfishness parlayed into a rewarding, challenging, sometime agonizing and exhausting career in the practice of law, as a prosecutor, criminal defense attorney, civil attorney, and finally, what became her passion, Family Law.
</p>
<p>	At the age of 13 years, she knew she wanted to become a lawyer.  She set a plan in motion and went to work — allowing no obstacles to defeat or dissuade her.    She graduated from Jefferson High School in Los Angeles.  She then attended Pitzer College in Claremont for her undergraduate studies on a full academic scholarship.  After undergraduate school, Judge Mablean took a break from academia.  In pursuit of her ultimate goal of being a lawyer, she took jobs related to law, beginning in law enforcement for the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a Correctional Officer in the Women’s Prison at Terminal Island.  From there, she became skillful in preparing documents for civil litigation and workers’ compensation as a secretary for the Law Offices of Eric Parkan.  A few years later, she progressed to the Law Offices of Stanley Sanders and Sandy English as a paralegal, where she engaged in researching and drafting contracts and partnership agreements in corporate and business law. 
</p>
<p>	During her break from school, she became a young wife and mother.   After four years, Judge Mablean decided it was time to enter law school.  She enrolled in the night program at Whittier College School of law in Los Angeles earning her Juris Doctor Degree in 1978. She participated in Moot Court and her team won second place in statewide Moot Court Honors Program.  Her law degree was earned without neglecting her family and making sure that her children kept their school studies up to par.  The completion of law school was just the beginning of an illustrious career heightened by countless awards and recognition.
</p>
<p>	Because she is such an unselfish, people-conscientious woman, who is well respected by colleagues and well known for her contributions, she has earned many awards as:  1997 Alumni of the Year-Whittier College; 1996 Zephyr Ramsey Award-Harriet Buhai [bew-high] Center of Family Law; 1996 Spencer Brandeis Award from the Family Law Section-Los Angeles Bar Association (she was the youngest recipient and first Black woman); 1996 Award of Excellence-State Women’s Department, Churches of God In Christ 1st Jurisdiction; 1995 Woman of the Year-California State Assembly 48th District; 1993 Distinguished Service-Women’s Lawyer 
	Association of Los Angeles (WLALA); 1990 Outstanding Leadership-Board of Directors, Harriet Buhai Center & Outstanding Contribution to Pro Bono Legal Services-Board of Governors, California State Bar Association:  1985 Outstanding Service-National Association of
	University Women and the 1978 Achievement Award-State Youth Department, Churches of God in Christ 1st Jurisdiction.  If that is not enough, Judge Ephriam has volunteered in numerous organizations and worked many jobs, such as: Hearing Examiner-City of L.A. Civil Service Commission; Board of Directors-Union Rescue Mission (first black woman); Member of American Bar Association and National Bar Association; Lecturer-Upward Bound Program, CSUBL; Motivational Speaker-L.A. City Schools; Co-Founder-Harriet Buhai Center for Family Law which provides free legal services for economically disadvantaged persons); Board of Directors-Southern California Women’s Dept./Retirement Center Committee, Churches of God In Christ – So. Calif. 1st Jurisdiction,  member and Past (1982-1983) President of Black Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>	In October of 1998, Twentieth Television selected this experienced, distinguished law practitioner and mediator to sit as Judge on the newly, revised half hour syndicated show “Divorce Court”, where there is no script, nor actors, just real cases and real litigants with Judge Mablean rendering legally-binding decisions.  This all came about by God’s divine will.  Judge Mablean did not seek the position.  Through word-of-mouth regarding her legal talents and referrals , Fox executives sought Judge Mablean, liked what they saw and offered her the show within seven (7) days.  Judge Mablean believes that this was a divine assignment,  
</p>
<p>	After ending her seven season run on Divorce Court (1999-2006), Judge Mablean is a much sought after public speaker for Women’s Conferences, Churches, Community and Civic Organizations, Colleges and Schools, dealing with relationship issues and motivating others to pursue their dreams.  She has written and published her first book, Life Lessons from Judge Mablean , 52 Lessons for Weekly Living and working on her second book,
</p>
<p>	Additionally, she is working on the mission of her nonprofit foundation, <a href="http://www.mableanephriamfoundation.com" target="_blank">The Mablean Ephriam Foundation</a>,  to build stronger families, educate minds, increase economic power among disadvantaged and lower economic persons and thus create better communities.  She is most thankful for the opportunity to provide day-to-day care to her elderly mother, who is almost 100 years old, who suffers from Alzheimer’s and other illnesses requiring full-time care.
</p>
<p>	This hard-working woman is an entrepreneur. She is the owner of Mablean’s Limousine Services; co-owner of Jubilane Guest House, a Bed & Breakfast in Johannesburg, South Africa; and founder of an awards program, <a href="http://www.hufawards.com" target="_blank">Honoring Unsung Fathers</a>.  
</p>
<p>	Judge Mablean attributes her success to God, her family and close friends.  Her faith, religion and trust in God keeps this mother of four and grandmother of nine,  meek and humble, and most of all, thankful.
